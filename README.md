# Webpack Template

A minimal Webpack 5 setup with separate **development** and **production** configs.  
Includes starter files for HTML, CSS, JS, and image support out of the box.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Split configs (`webpack.common.js`, `webpack.dev.js`, `webpack.prod.js`)
- Live reloading with `webpack-dev-server`
- Automatic HTML generation via `HtmlWebpackPlugin`
- Extracted & minified CSS with `MiniCssExtractPlugin` + `CssMinimizerPlugin`
- Asset loading for images (PNG, JPG, SVG, GIF)

---

## 🛠️ Installation

Clone this template and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## 🧰 Available Commands

- **`npm run build`**  
  Builds the project using the production configuration (`webpack.prod.js`).

  - Outputs optimized and minified files to the `dist/` folder.

- **`npm start` OR `npm run dev`**  
  Starts the Webpack development server with live reloading.

  - Opens automatically in your browser.
  - Uses `webpack.dev.js` for faster, non-minified builds.

- **`npm run deploy`**  
  Deploys the contents of the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub.

  - Use this after running `npm run build`.

- **`npm run clean`**  
  Deletes the `dist/` folder to start with a fresh build.
  - On Windows, use `rimraf dist` instead of `rm -rf dist` for compatibility.

---

## 💻 Development

Run the dev server with hot reloading:

```bash
npm start
```

- Opens automatically at **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**

---

## 📦 Production Build

Build an optimized version for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

- Output files go into the `dist/` folder
- CSS and JS are automatically minified
- HTML is generated with correct asset links

---

## 🧹 Cleanup

Remove the build folder:

```bash
npm run clean
```

---

## 🧠 Notes

- The `/dist` folder is **ignored** in Git; it’s generated by Webpack.
- To deploy to GitHub Pages:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  git add dist -f && git commit -m "Deployment commit"
  git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
  ```
